An Emotion Centric Content Classification System

## Description:

Current content delivery systems fail to utilize emotional statuses of users. We propose to build an emotionally intelligent content recommendation system.  Users will choose their desired emotional state and the recommendation system will deliver a piece of content with a high likelihood of eliciting the desired emotion.

## Tools:

- Emotional Classification: Affectiva API using Javascript SDK
- Web Development Framework: Flask 
- Database: NoSQL Couchdb

## Modeling
